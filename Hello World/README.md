## Hello World example

This is a minimal example code using UART0 on a eZ80F92 to talk with the ESP32 video terminal. Note that example code does not use the C Runtime nor the ZSL libraries.

**Note that this needs at least AGON VPD Version 0.02 which is not using hardware flow control.**



### What is Agon

Agon is a modern, fully open-source, 8-bit microcomputer and microcontroller in one small, low-cost board. As a computer, it is a standalone device that requires no host PC: it puts out its own video (VGA), audio (2 identical mono channels), accepts a PS/2 keyboard and has its own mass-storage in the form of a ÂµSD card.
